I am a Ph.D candidate in the [Natural Language Processing Lab](http://u.cs.biu.ac.il/~nlp/) at [Bar-Ilan University](https://www1.biu.ac.il/), under the supervision of [Prof. Ido Dagan](https://u.cs.biu.ac.il/~dagan/) and [Prof. Jacob Goldberger](http://www.eng.biu.ac.il/goldbej/). My main research interests are Multi Document Summarization and semantic relations between texts.

Prior to that, I finished my M.Sc. (magna cum laude) in the [Speech Processing Lab](https://research.biu.ac.il/labs/prof-gannots-lab/), and my B.Sc. (summa cum laude), both in Electrical Engineering.

Until recently, I was an NLP research intern at IBM, and beforehand I worked as a Data Scientist at Intel and as a firmware engineer at Mellanox.

I like good music and I volunteer at "Paamonim‚Äù- an organization promoting financial responsibility.
