I am a Ph.D. student in the [Faculty of Engineering](https://engineering.biu.ac.il/en) at [Bar Ilan University](https://www.biu.ac.il/en), under the supervision of [Prof. Jacob Goldberger](http://www.eng.biu.ac.il/goldbej/). My main research interests are domain adaptation of speech systems and calibration of neural networks. Prior to that, I finished my M.Sc. (magna cum laude) under the supervision of [Prof. Jacob Goldberger](http://www.eng.biu.ac.il/goldbej/), and my B.Sc. (summa cum laude), both in Electrical Engineering.

I currently work at [OriginAI](https://il.linkedin.com/company/originai) as a Deep Learning researcher in the Speech and Audio group.

As part of my role, I delivered a professional course on reinforcement learning to researchers from multiple teams within the organization. [Slides](https://www.dropbox.com/scl/fo/vasp7sfxtcbw4yrzqf9a6/AH-2J5zj4V0sc78EzQw_o1g?rlkey=ndoz3a5goybhgz88d6qd2417d&st=h1tyjux4&dl=0)
