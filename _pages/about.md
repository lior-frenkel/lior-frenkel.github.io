I am a Ph.D. student in the [Faculty of Engineering](https://engineering.biu.ac.il/en) at [Bar Ilan University](https://www.biu.ac.il/en), under the supervision of [Prof. Jacob Goldberger](http://www.eng.biu.ac.il/goldbej/). My main research interests are domain adaptation of speech systems and calibration of neural networks. Prior to that, I finished my M.Sc. (magna cum laude) under the supervision of [Prof. Jacob Goldberger](http://www.eng.biu.ac.il/goldbej/), and my B.Sc. (summa cum laude), both in Electrical Engineering.

In recent years, I have also been working at [OriginAI](https://il.linkedin.com/company/originai) as a Deep Learning researcher in the Speech and Audio group.
