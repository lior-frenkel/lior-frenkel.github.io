I am a postdoctoral researcher in the [Natural Language Processing Lab](https://www.cs.mcgill.ca/~jcheung/group.html) at [McGill University](https://mcgill-nlp.github.io/) & [Mila](https://mila.quebec/en/) working with [Prof. Jackie Cheung](https://www.cs.mcgill.ca/~jcheung/). I have completed my Ph.D. in the [Natural Language Processing Lab](https://biu-nlp.github.io/) at [Bar-Ilan University](https://www1.biu.ac.il/), under the supervision of [Prof. Ido Dagan](https://u.cs.biu.ac.il/~dagan/) and [Prof. Jacob Goldberger](http://www.eng.biu.ac.il/goldbej/). My main research interests are automatic summarization and semantic relations between texts. Prior to that, I finished my M.Sc. (magna cum laude) in the [Speech Processing Lab](https://research.biu.ac.il/labs/prof-gannots-lab/), and my B.Sc. (summa cum laude), both in Electrical Engineering.

During my graduate studies, I was fortunate to intern at Amazon Research, IBM Research, and Intel (AI Solutions group).

I like good music and I volunteer at "Paamonim‚Äù- an organization promoting financial responsibility.
